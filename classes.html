        <h2>Data Science</h2>
        <h3> DSC 40A: Theoretical Foundations of Data Science I, Spring 2024</h3>
        <p>The sequence DSC 40A-B introduces the theoretical foundations of data science. DSC 40A, 
            the first course in the sequence, exposes students to the mathematical theory underlying 
            fundamental topics in machine learning. Topics include empirical risk minimization, 
            optimization, regression, classification, and discrete probability. Students practice 
            creative problem-solving while learning how to rigorously justify and communicate mathematical 
            ideas. </p>

        <h3> DSC 30: Data Structures and Algorithms for Data Science, Spring 2024</h3>
        <p> Builds on topics covered in DSC 20 and provides practical experience in composing larger 
            computational systems through several significant programming projects using Java. 
            Students will study advanced programming techniques including encapsulation, abstract data 
            types, interfaces, algorithms and complexity, and data structures such as stacks, queues, 
            priority queues, heaps, linked lists, binary trees, binary search trees, and hash tables.  
        </p>

        <h3> DSC 20: Programming and Basic Data Structures for Data Science, Winter 2024</h3>
        <p> Provides an understanding of the structures that underlie the programs, algorithms, and languages 
            used in data science by expanding the repertoire of computational concepts introduced in DSC 10 
            and exposing students to techniques of abstraction. Course will be taught in Python and will 
            cover topics including recursion, higher-order functions, function composition, 
            object-oriented programming, interpreters, classes, and simple data structures such as arrays, 
            lists, and linked lists.  
        </p>

        <h3> DSC 10: Principles of Data Science, Fall 2023</h3>
        <p> This first course in data science introduces students to data exploration, statistical inference, 
            and prediction. It introduces the Python programming language as a tool for tabular data manipulation, 
            visualization, and simulation. Through homework assignments and projects, students are given an opportunity 
            to develop their analytical skills while working with real-world datasets from a variety of domains.  
        </p>



        <h2>Cognitive Science</h2>
        <h3> COGS 14B: Introduction to Statistical Analysis, Spring 2024</h3>
        <p>Introduction to descriptive and inferential statistics. Tables, graphs, measures of central tendency and 
            variability. Distributions, Z-scores, correlation, regression. Probability, sampling, logic of inferential statistics, 
            hypothesis testing, decision theory. T-test, one and two-way Anova, nonparametric tests (Chi-square). 
        </p>
        
        <h3> COGS 14A: Introduction to Research Methods, Winter 2024</h3>
        <p> Introduction to the scientific method. Methods of knowledge acquisition, research questions, hypotheses, 
            operational definitions, variables, control. Observation, levels of measurement, reliability, validity. Experimentation
             and design: between-groups, within-subjects, quasi-experimental, factorial, single-subject. Correlational and observational 
             studies. Ethics in research.
        </p>

        <h3> COGS 9: Introduction to Data Science, Winter 2024</h3>
        <p> Concepts of data and its role in science will be introduced, as well as the ideas behind data-mining, text-mining, machine learning, 
            and graph theory, and how scientists and companies are leveraging those methods to uncover new insights into human cognition.
        </p>

        <h3> COGS 15: What the *#!?: An Uncensored Introduction to Language , Fall 2023</h3>
        <p>This course uses the study of swearing to introduce topics in language: how children learn it, why it changes over time, and how people pronounce 
            and understand it. 
        </p>



        <h2>Math</h2>
        <h3> MATH 20C: Calculus and Analytic Geometry for Science and Engineering, Fall 2023</h3>
        <p>Vector geometry, vector functions and their derivatives. Partial differentiation. Maxima and minima. Double integration.
        </p>
        
        <h3> MATH 18: Linear Algebra, Summer 2023</h3>
        <p> Matrix algebra, Gaussian elimination, determinants. Linear and affine subspaces, bases of Euclidean spaces. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors, 
            quadratic forms, orthogonal matrices, diagonalization of symmetric matrices. Applications. Computing symbolic and graphical solutions using MATLAB. 
        </p>

        <h2>Other Courses</h2>
        <h3> WCWP 10B: The Writing Course B: Communicating Climate Justice, Spring 2024</h3>
        <p>The climate crisis is real, and the impacts of climate disruption are already being felt here in San Diego and across California. However, 
            those impacts are not being distributed equally. Furthermore, according to recent studies, only 43% of Californians talk about the climate crisis
             with others on a regular basis. In other words, the problem is big. It is real. We need solutions. And we need hope. But we don't know how to talk 
             or write in ways that spur action or inspire hope. So, what should we do?
            Our course explores these topics and tensions by asking big questions. How will the climate crisis impact people we love and care about in our local 
            communities? What solutions are most needed in our cities and towns? How should we teach about the solutions in our local schools? In our favorite majors 
            and classes? And how can we communicate to inspire action, change, hope in the face of challenge.
        </p>

        <h3> WCWP 10A: The Writing Course A, Winter 2024</h3>
        <p> A seminar-style course in reading and writing required of all Warren College students. The course emphasizes argumentation and critical writing based on sources.
